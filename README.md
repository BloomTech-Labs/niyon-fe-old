## Project Overview

[Trello Board] https://trello.com/b/fvJgJWWA/niyon

Find a mentor.
Niyon is a platform for connecting young professionals with mentors in West Africa.
We connect you with mentors who are located in the same city, town or local government area you are in.

### Key Features

- Create your account or login with your social account
- Connect with mentors and mentees
- Chat with them

## Tech Stack

## Front End Frameworks & Libraries

### **React**

- is such a popular library, many modules are available, as is plenty of up-to-date information about it.
- Performance - ReactJS its using a virtual DOM that provides superior performance
- reusable Components - React provides a component based structure. You can re-use components anywhere you need. As a result, (1) your app has¬†consistent look and feel, (2) code re-use makes it easier to¬†maintain and grow your codebase, and (3) it is¬†easier to develop¬†your app.
- native Approach: React can be use to create mobile application( react native) .React code its really reusable. So at the same time someone can make IOS , Android application

### **Next JS**

Handles routing (replaces React Router), clear separation between pages and components. Client-side rendered which makes loading faster.

### **Hooks**

Hooks makes it easier to update state, there's also no need for class components or lifecycle methods like componentDidMount.

### **Redux**

Provides one source of truth for state, easier to manage the application state if working in a group.

Our team has extensive experience in ReactJS and NextJS was chosen over React because of the server side rendering and integrated tooling/router.

Hooks enable us to manage our state such as (form handling, dropdown menu etc) in a functional components.

Redux provides us with the ability to manage our state in a central store that can be accessed by all components.

### **Styled Components**

Can have reusable components (easier to have a style guide), easier to organize than other CSS in JS methods (e.g. components can be kept in one file or sorted by type) :

- scoped styles
- normal CSS syntax
- props based conditional style
- create reusable style
- native mobile support - for teams with a React codebase who also use React Native for mobile development, styled-components is one of the best-unified solution out there

## User Auth

### Passport JS

Passport JS is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped into any Express-based web application. It has a social authentication feature that helps with authenticating users via their social handles like facebook, twitter, etc by interacting with these social handle API. It is compatible to use, free, flexible and secured.

For users registering directly to our platform, we will use JSON Web Token.

PassportJS allows us to integrate a lot of different auth providers (facebook, etc.) and also enables us to integrate OAuth (all different versions).

## Chat

### socket.io

[Socket.io](http://socket.io) is a chat framework that performs real-time chat analytics and is compatible across all platforms (web, mobile) and devices.

### ‚áí Our choice: socket.io

We choose [socket.io](http://socket.io) over Pusher because it gives us more flexibility, isn't a third party service (limited plan available for free).

Moreover, [socket.io](http://socket.io) have the following 3 unique features:

- Real-time analytics - Push data to clients that gets represented as real-time counters, charts or logs.
- Binary streaming - Starting in 1.0, it's possible to send any blob back and forth: image, audio, video.
- Instant messaging and chat - Socket.IO's "Hello world" is a chat app in just a few lines of code.

#### Front end deployed to:

### **Heroku - Development, Staging (Backend + Front-end)**

Heroku is a platform as a service for Amazon Web Services. Heroku makes it easy to set up an AWS deployment by handling most of the set up. This is ideal for development and staging as we can test projects without having to worry about too much set up.

### **Circle CI - Testing**

Continuous integration is crucial in modern web development as it ensures all automated tests pass before merging branches and deploying. This ensures bugs are caught at the earliest possible stage.

### **Now - Production (Front-end )**

ZEIT Now is a really simple and scalable way to deploy your application. Pages are deployed as server-less functions meaning billing only occurs in 100ms increments when the site is actually being used. Also as we are using Next.js, also a Zeit product, this allows a seem-less deployment process with two products designed to work together.

#### [Back end] https://github.com/labseu2-niyon/backend built using:

# Back-end

## Database

### **PostgreSQL**

PostgreSQL is one of the largest open-source RBMS that comes with many features aimed to help developers build applications, administrators to protect data integrity and build fault-tolerant environments, and help you manage your data no matter how big or small the database is.

We started with comparing SQL vs NoSQL. Our first tech choices were PostgreSQL and MongoDB. We choose PostgreSQL for our project because our application would contain and operate with a lot of relationships, therefore, using a relational database system with a large community that protects data integrity and tolerant environment.

## Framework

### **Node**

Node is a server side environment where javascript can run. Having both our client and server code with the same language is helpful to our team's communication and integration.

### **Express**

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

### **Sequelize**

Sequelize is perhaps the most popular and used promised base Javascript SQL ORM that is compatible with PostgreSQL and helps us handle relationships and their query.


Having both our client and server code with the same language is helpful to our team's communication and integration. 

We also considered which language all of our team was comfortable to work with, and that's why we settled on Node + Express.

Sequelize is an ORM which can help us handle associations and their queries, and knex is only a query builder. This will make it the setup easier with sequelize.

## APIs query type

### **Rest API**

REST API is a simple and popular architecture type both for client and server-side that helps us perform all CRUD operations. Since REST was covered in the curriculum and also effectively solves our problem in the early circle we would be starting with it.

## Testing

### **Jest Framework**

Jest is a testing framework that focuses on simplicity. It was covered in the curriculum, have awesome documentation and practically covers every aspect of testing; from unit-test to snap-shot test, etc. 

Jest have both units test, snap-shot test and react test. It's also simple and simply delightful.

## **Continous Integration**

Using continuous integration for our test helps us deploy our application dynamically, supports our development process by automatically building and testing code changes, providing immediate feedback on the success of the change.

### **Circle CI**

Circle CI is a fast automated triggered continuous integration service.

Circle CI has a hub and automate all process of automated integration, from base to end. Automatically deploy to heroku, etc.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

üö´These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app

    *  REACT_APP_apiKey - this is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console
    *  REACT_APP_authDomain - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_databaseURL - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_projectID - in the Firebase dashboard
